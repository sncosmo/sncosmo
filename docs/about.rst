Package Features
================

- **SN models:** Synthesize supernova spectra and photometry from SN
  models.

- **Fitting and sampling:** Functions for fitting and sampling SN
  model parameters given photometric light curve data.

- **I/O:** Convenience functions for reading and writing peculiar data
  formats used in other packages.

- **Built-in supernova models** such as SALT2, MLCS2k2, Hsiao, Nugent,
  PSNID, SNANA and Whalen models, as well as a variety of built-in
  bandpasses and magnitude systems.

- **Extensible:** New models, bandpasses, and magnitude systems can be
  defined, using an object-oriented interface.


The name SNCosmo
================

A natural choice, "snpy", was already in use by the "SNooPy" package,
so I tried to be a little more descriptive. The package is really specific
to supernova *cosmology*, as it doesn't cover other types of supernova
science (radiative transfer simulations for instance).  Hence
"sncosmo".
